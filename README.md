# Cross Words PuzzleðŸ§©

This is a Java Swing-based Crossword Puzzle for fun and interactive puzzle-solving.

## Description

The application allows users to play crossword puzzles of different sizes (4x4 and 6x6). Each cell in the puzzle contains a single character, and the user can attempt to solve the puzzles by filling in the correct characters.

The application also includes a timer that starts as soon as the user begins playing a puzzle, keeping track of the time period for which the user has played. Additionally, the application stores the details of the highest scorer to date.

The admin, who is the owner of the site, has the following functionalities:
- Generate puzzles of different sizes (4x4 or 6x6) by assigning questions based on the table size and cell availability.
- Assign the character "*" to cells where data entry is not required.

The user has the following functionalities:
- Attempt the puzzle by editing the cells that are not filled with the character "*".
- Users, other than the admin, cannot edit cells filled with "*".
- Submit the puzzle after attempting it.
- View the answers for the puzzle they attempted.
